# 🧠 Memory Click

## 📌 About the Game
**Memory Click** is a **memory-based puzzle game** (made in Godot) where players must **repeat the sequence of clicks** generated by the computer. The challenge grows with each level as the sequence extends, testing both memory and concentration.

This mini-game was created as part of my training to **improve development skills** and explore interactive mechanics.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Press the Start button** – The game begins, and a sequence is shown.
2. **Watch carefully** – The buttons will be disabled one by one in a specific order.
3. **Repeat the sequence** – Click the buttons in the exact same order.
4. **Progress through levels** – Each level adds a new step to the existing sequence.
5. **Make a mistake?** – Start over from level 1 and try again!

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics
- The game consists of **9 interactive buttons**.
- A **sequence** is generated randomly, increasing in length as levels progress.
- The game **visually demonstrates the correct sequence** before allowing input.
- If a player **clicks the wrong button**, they return to the first level.
- The game has **no ending** – only **an ever-growing sequence** leading to a very, very (very) long gameplay.

## 🚀 Features
✔️ Simple yet engaging **memory-based mechanics**  
✔️ Increasing **difficulty over time**  
✔️ **Infinite** levels – play as long as your brain can handle!  
✔️ A nearly **endless, almost boring challenge** for true memory champions

## 🏆 Goal
How far can you go before your brain melts?  
Enjoy a **long, very long, almost unnecessarily long** memory test! 😈
